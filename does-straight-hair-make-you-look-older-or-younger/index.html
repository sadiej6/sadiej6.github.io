Wedding Updo Hair Styles Do bangs make you look younger From pinterest.com
There are many ways to wear long hair, including braids, ponytails, upsweeps and more. Personally i don�t see how someone�s hair would affect how young or old they look, unless it�s gray. Dark brown and black hair color often makes light skin look older and outlines all the wrinkles and creases you might have. This is a great option for brunettes looking for an easy change that isn�t too extreme.
