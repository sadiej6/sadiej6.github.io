Too Short on Dress and Time Trophy Boutique From trophyboutique.com
Even those so called acceptable dresses above are too short regardless the woman’s age!!!! If your clothes are too tight, they�ll be uncomfortable to work in, but if they�re too loose, they�ll look sloppy and unprofessional. The issue is the wide horizontal pink band which cuts a borderline too short dress into an even shorter visual. If one cares to note, it�s ironic to see some women wearing skirts or dresses that are too short pull and tug every few seconds to maintain modesty when the easiest solution would have been to choose something else to wear.
