If you want to remove some bulk from your hair, ask your hairstylist to use a razor to help thin it out. To straighten your hair if you’re a man, brush it with a wide tooth comb after you’ve showered every 5 minutes until it dries, which will make it dry straighter. Using a fat round brush can be good as the bristles are close together and the action of brushing the hair plus the heat from the blow dryer will move the hair from curly to straight. This will help make your hair appear smoother.
