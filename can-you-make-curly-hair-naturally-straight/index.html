How to Straight To Curly Routine (Zero Damage) YouTube From youtube.com

If your hair is truly just wavy, you can’t just make it curly naturally. If you notice many children have straight hair until adolescence and then it turns curly and similar changes occur during menopause. But beauty standards impact all women and those with naturally straight hair, believe it or not, spend just as much time attempting to bring some volume and texture to their linear tresses.
