If your hair is two inches long and you’re aiming for shoulder length (about 12 inches) growth, that adds up to a little less than two years to reach your goal. However, if it is in the range of medium length then it will not take you more than an hour. Long hair takes a fuckton more work than short hair though. This causes damage to the follicle, and it generally takes two to three weeks to repair and grow a new shaft long enough for you to see.
