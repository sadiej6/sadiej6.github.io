Hair loss is a common symptom of thyroid disease but it can also be caused by various other conditions including vitamin and mineral deficiencies and certain medical conditions. Too little thyroid hormone can cause dry, brittle hair. If you aren�t aware of this problem then you can continually adjust your dose up and down trying to fix the problem only to later find out that the problem is with the medication and not the dose. An overactive or underactive thyroid is not the only cause of hair loss.
