40 Statement Hairstyles for Men with Thick Hair From therighthairstyles.com
To style short hair as a guy, start by working some styling product, like putty or pomade, into your hair while it’s damp. If you have very long locks and are more skilled with hair techniques like braiding, give this one a whirl. The products that you apply to your hair over time may build up and cause your hair to look dull and lifeless. This allows the entire head to look like it is bigger, which makes the hair look thicker as well.
