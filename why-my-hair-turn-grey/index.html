Why Does Hair Turn Gray? Kristin Moon Science From kristinmoonscience.com
Hair owes its colour to pigments (melanin) produced by particular cells in our hair. This gene is in charge of regulating and producing melanin. While there should be a reprieve from bleaching hair too often, the color can easily be corrected. And, much like people, as dogs age , the pigment cells responsible for color (particularly, melanin) stop producing, causing the strands to appear lighter in color, such as gray or white.
