Does blonde hair color make you look younger? If you have naturally dark hair, keep in mind that platinum hair will be high maintenance for you. If you’d rather get your hair done a few times a year, you’d be better off with a subtle shade of blonde worked into a balayage or color melt. Your roots will grow in dark, which could look tacky next to your blonde hair, so make sure you�re committed to the hair color before you make the plunge.
