Your hair may turn grey because it is in your genes to do so, you have developed an autoimmune disorder, you lacked certain vitamins or chemicals in your body, or your lifestyle has sped your body’s aging process. It can affect patches on your head, eyebrows , eyelashes, arms, and the surrounding skin and scalp. Although the underlying mechanisms are still not clearly defined, the most common explanation for the premature whitening or graying of hair is genetics. This condition can cause single or, less commonly, multiple white patches on the hair.
