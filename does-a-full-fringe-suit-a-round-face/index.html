Bangs for Round Face Fashionable Fringes to Suit Your Frame From allthingshair.com
What fringe suits a round face? Waves will provide enough volume and will not accentuate the rounded face shape. But the best shape for a full fringe is square or a long face shape, the illusion is that they soften the strong jawline. if you don�t have a square or a long face (i have a decidedly round one), don�t let that put you off. Perfect pixie for a round face should have sharp vertical lines.
