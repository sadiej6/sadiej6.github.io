They quantify the amount of cut or fill with a negative or positive number, respectively. Through fill—opposite of a through cut, a through fill is a segment of road that is entirely composed of fill material, with fill slopes on both sides of the road. If you want your cut to appear as a dashed line so that you can differentiate it when printing in black and white, edit the linestyle for cut, within your style manager. A ‘cut’ is made when earth is cut from above the desired ground height and a ‘fill’ is when earth is used to fill a hole to desired ground level.
