Why is my hair straight/wavy on the top and back but curly From reddit.com
Curly hair is an autosomal dominant trait ().an autosomal dominant trait is when one parent has a mutated (and dominant) gene while the other does not. Since we don�t all have the same hair type and were not all growing the same size dreads it makes sense that the maintenance we�ll need to do will vary from person to person. That�s just how dreads are. It occurs around the age of 51 on average and may be the cause of your hair turning straight from curly.
