It is dht that blocks the hair follicle cycle leading to hair thinning and loss, especially on the scalp. One of the symptoms known is thinning hair and/or hair loss from the head. Hair loss certainly isn’t a common side effect of pcos. This is mostly due to the excess androgenic hormones that people with pcos often have, which can lead to acne, thinning hair, and hair loss, as well as limp, lackluster hair that breaks easily and is dry and damaged.
