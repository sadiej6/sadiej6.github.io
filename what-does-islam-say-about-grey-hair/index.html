It is permissible to dye the hair any colour apart from black, and there is no differentiation in this regard between old men and young men. Islam means submitting ones will to allah�s will, when allah created his creation, he did not invite anyone to have a say in what he was going to create. But in the case of ghusul (process of purifying the entire body via a bath) from janabah and menses, the hairs need to be done and washed so that all of the hairs are completely wet and the water reached your skull. White hair may be meant to comfort you more than it is.
