Number 8 Guard Haircut Haircuts you�ll be asking for in 2020 From lovingbohr.blogspot.com
While i don�t have thinning hair, a buzz has been my preferred haircut my whole life. For me, the buzzed or bald head is way more attractive then the hanging on. Mine started thinning on top about 20 years ago and i tried to just have a normal haircut at first, then when i moved to jakarta in 95 i found a no2 was the ideal solution to both the thinning hair and the sticky heat and humidity that is prevalent out. I am going to suggest you shave it or buzz it.
