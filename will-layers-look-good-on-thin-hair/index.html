But this is only true for hair that has some volume in the first place. If your hair is wavy or curly, adding layers to the hair will allow the shorter layers to curl more and will let you style the hair to add volume and give the appearance of more hair. This is especially important for women who have long, thin hair. Whether or not a person with curly hair will look good with a layered haircut depends largely on how curly the hair is, the texture of the hair, and the hair’s density, and the kind of layering that is done.
