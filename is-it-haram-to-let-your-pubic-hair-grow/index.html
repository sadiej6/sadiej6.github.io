Boob Growth &amp; Pubic Hair Let�s Talk About Puberty From libresse.co.za
If you want to shave some or all of your pubic hair, you can still be as careful and as safe as possible while doing so, to decrease your chances of ingrown hairs, cuts and discomfort. This can lead to redness, pain, and tiny bumps in the area. When you treat your pubic hair to this mixture, it will soften over time and grow out more healthy. If that doesn’t sound like something you want to put up with, leaving your pubic hair alone is also perfectly acceptable.
