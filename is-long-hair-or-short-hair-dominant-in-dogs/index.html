Long haired german shepherd puppies are less common than short haired. Among dogs, short hair is dominant to long hair and dark coat color is dominant to white (albino) coat color. Thus, dogs with the genotype “ll” and “ll” have short hair. In dogs, dark coat color is dominant over albino and short hair is dominant over long hair.
