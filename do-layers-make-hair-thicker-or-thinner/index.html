<meta name="description" content="Do Layers Make Hair Thicker Or Thinner, Well, layers won’t make your hair thicker, but they can create quite the visual effect! The inverted bob is a great layered hairstyle for thin hair as the cutting technique adds volume and a nice rounded shape at the back for a fuller look.

My first clue as to why you shouldn�t get layers was how quickly my hair fell flat after i got my cut. Creating that blunt, strong line around the perimeter of the hair will give the appearance of thicker, stronger hair. You can also try wetting your hair and applying a volumizing mousse before you go to bed, which will give your hair a thicker, texturized appearance in the morning. Trimming your hair gets rid of length that could be weighing your hair down (the opposite of what you want if you�re looking for a more voluminous �do).
