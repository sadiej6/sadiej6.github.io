2021 Popular Long Hairstyles That Make You Look Thinner From inflexa.com
The longer length (try for shoulder length or longer) draws the eye down and makes your face appear slimmer. Height and bone structure can also be at odds, if you are short and also have a round face we recommend you get a bob as very long hair will enhance your round face and make you look smaller. So i�m wondering if there are men out there who can vouch for the fact that growing your hair out fairly long is capable of giving the illusion that the face is slimmer. Lighter tones open up the face, making it appear wider, while darker tones are slimming, says dubre.
