How to Grow Hair Back After Shaving Your Head From livestrong.com
Grooming leg hair doesn�t have to involve shaving at all. There is nothing in the quran or the sunnah which prohibits the believers from removing ones excess hair from ones arms, or legs, or chest, or back, etc., either through shaving, waxing, clipping, or through the use of shaving or waxing creams, etc., if one wishes to do so. If you are cutting and trimming unnecessary hair them that should be fine because grooming is okay in islam as long as you are also doing it for the right purpose. Whatever written of truth and benefit is only due to allahs assistance and guidance, and whatever of error is of me alone.
