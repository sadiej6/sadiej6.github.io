Should I be concerned about this hair loss/thinning From reddit.com
It might be less damaging to bleach it if you go to a hair salon but i know for a fact that if you want it bleached white you will have to bleach your hair once a month to gradually lighten it. The chemicals in bleach can permanently alter the texture of your hair, especially if you bleach frequently. It changes the hair texture by creating either curls or waves. Unlike other oils like argan (which can be tinged yellow and might stain bleached hair), dueñas tells me that marula oil has the unique capability of penetrating deep into the hair’s cuticle for ultimate healing and repair.
