The BEST Way To Care For Curly Hair… Safe &amp; NonToxic! From wardee.com
Don’t brush your hair except while in the shower with conditioner in your hair. My hair is knotty, so i use my fingers to detangle it every night before i sleep, and i use a wide tooth comb with plenty of conditioner in the shower. I prefer to let their hair air dry, but if you need to dry it quickly (like before bed) then use a hair dryer diffuser on medium/low heat. I just set it on my bathroom counter and lean the section of hair i’m refreshing into the steam and cup my hand under that section and lift the section up to encourage waves.
