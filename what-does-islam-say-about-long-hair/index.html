Afaik, we don�t have any hadith that says directly it�s wrong to have long hairs, but we have hadith that says to men, don�t make yourself like woman (don�t shave your beard) and also don�t make yourself like kufaars (the reason some muslim don�t grow moustache, because at the time, persian empire men used to grow moustache).
