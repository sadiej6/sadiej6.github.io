As you are waiting for your edges to grow back, if you want to hold a puff, leave the edges and some hair in the front out and style with a twist braid or leave the front hair hanging. Our pharmacist blended hair growth formula might help restore your edges. It all depends on the technique the barber has used, how they have styled your hair, and how thin they are keeping the strands. Avoid placing scarves and headbands on your hairline as the tension can lead to thinning edges.
