What does my birthmark say about me From upprevention.org
A spiritual seeker or a sadhaka who is not only seeking for his spiritual wellbeing, but who is seeking to become an instrument of a larger possibility, wants to use every little support available in nature. The name “dreadlocks” is a symbol that unholy people fear of the power of the holy. Dating back to the greeks and romans, long hair was the ultimate symbol of femininity, health. The hair can reflect our innermost emotions and traits and is a unique source of spiritual power and energy.
