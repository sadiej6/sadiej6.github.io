So, does hair length affect balding? When you have super long hair, going with your natural hairstyle isn�t just about confidence and positive body image, it’s about time management and general laziness too. Since you don’t normally take photos from behind you, the easiest way to compare the level of thickness in your hair over time is to take photos every two to three months in your bathroom mirror. Meaning if you�re out of shape, not dressed well, have poor presentation and grooming, long hair tends to make you look a bit more of that.
