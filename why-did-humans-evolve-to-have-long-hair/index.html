It presumably evolved from the head louse after humans lost their body hair and started wearing clothes. In rare cases, the regression is incomplete and usually surgically removed at birth. The head is brachycephalic or mesocephalic, the skull usually devoid of prominent brow ridges. Early ancestors of humans evolved to walk upright on two legs around 6 million years ago.
