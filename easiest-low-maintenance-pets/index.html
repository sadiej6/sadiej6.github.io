The 10 Best Low Maintenance Pets For Families From petnpat.com
When it comes to low maintenance pets for your kids, the easiest and best beginner pets are those that require little to no work on your part. Degus, which come from chile and are a type of rodent similar to a guinea pig, make surprisingly easy pets when socialized from a young age. Nocturnal pets are also low maintenance pets because they are awake during the night and require very little attention during the day (while you might be away). Fish is low maintenance, a distant companion, and probably the best first pet for children.
