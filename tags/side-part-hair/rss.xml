How to care for hair that�s a mix of wavy and straight From reddit.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curly hair tends to be much drier than straight hair because it is easier for the oils secreted from the scalp to travel down the shaft of a straight hair than a curly one (this is why curly hair often turns into frizzy hair). To say that there is an ongoing debate about the merits of straight and curly hair[1] is an understatement. However, in curly hair, the way that the cells divide and produce certain proteins is asymmetrical and correlates with the bends in the curved follicle. The straight hair is usually soft, which makes it shinier and easier to keep it neat&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;However if this is causing you to worry, after you put your headband on, you can push it forward a little bit so it’s still holding you hair back but not “pulling” it, if that makes sense. But in most people, stress isn’t the cause of graying. In some cases, the hair loss will cause the stress, rather than the other way around. Although your stressful job could make you live longer, it’s not doing much good for your hair health.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
