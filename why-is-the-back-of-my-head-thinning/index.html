In males, hair thinning tends to occur from the hairline to the back of the head. Hairline hairs (perimeter hairs) are thin on everyone compared to the rest of hairs on our head. Male pattern hair loss can show up with thinning on the crown of your head, at the vertex (in an m or v shape), or a receding hairline. My hair that is thinning is also losing its color, and you can see all these blonde hairs on my head, as my hair is naturally brown.
