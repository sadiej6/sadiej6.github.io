How to cut men’s hair Tips for athome hair trims HELLO! From hellomagazine.com
Once you have your clippers adjusted, start from the bottom of the hairline and shave in smooth cuts all around the head, moving from the bottom to the top. Do some blending to get rid of the lines between the two layers of hair on your sides. Go all the way up to the section line you created through the sides and back, then use the next number down on the clipper, doing the same motion but stopping around 1.5 inches from the section line to create a blend. To blend hair, use a clipper guard number that’s between the numbers used to cut the top and bottom parts of your sides.
