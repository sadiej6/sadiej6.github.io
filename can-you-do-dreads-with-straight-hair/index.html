Dreadlocks Straight Hair Dreads A to Z Starting dreads From blognyatonidi.blogspot.com
This is because your hair grows only so much each year and in the beginning, your hair might not be able to hold a dread (it does at about 7 centimeters). If you don’t mind waiting for up to 3 years, you can also grow dreadlocks naturally. If you had an entire head of dreads and tried washing them every day, the extra loose hair would be out of control and it would take too much time to manage each day, but with only a few dreads it won�t take that long, and after the first 10 washings they should have less and less loose hair. Obviously, i can�t see your head, but if you have slick, straight hair, they won�t automatically coil around a dread and �hide� like curly/kinky hair will.
