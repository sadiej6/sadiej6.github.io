This change in direction can result in either the refraction or reflection of the wave. You can learn about this in seismic waves which have s (shear) and p (compressive) waves. Longitudinal waves because the displacement of the medium is in the same direction as, or the opposite direction to, (parallel to) the direction of propagation of the wave; The speed of p waves and s waves increases as they travel deeper into the earth’s mantle.

<p>P, primary, or compressional waves travel the fastest (~6 km/sec in the upper crust).

<p>When they change speed, the also change direction. Therefore as they travel from one medium into another, they change speed. These cause thermal and compositional diffusion and result in attenuation. Seismic velocities depend on the material properties such as composition, mineral phase and packing structure, temperature, and pressure of the media through which seismic waves pass.

<p>As an s wave passes through a material, the site of its passing moves from side to side or up and down (as compared to the direction the wave is traveling). Let me just make that clear.

<p>This is why s waves are also known as transverse waves.

When the waves cross the boundary between two different layers, there is a sudden change in direction due to refraction.</h3><p>Different parts of the earths interior have different densities useful information regarding the composition of the interior of the earth can be derived from earthquakes because earthquake waves Shear waves push the solid side to side orthogonal to the direction of wave travel. Which statement best explains why the direction of some seismic waves change sharply as the waves travel through the earth? “transverse” comes from the latin words for “turned across.”) s waves cannot travel through liquids or gases. Compressive waves compress or rarify the density of the material in the direction of the wave travel. Their direction also changes as they reflect or refract when coming across materials with different densities.</p>
<p>C1.5 propagation of seismic waves as a seismic wave travels through the earth, several factors will change the direction and amplitude of the waves. Seismic wave studies have allowed.
