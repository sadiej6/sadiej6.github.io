Why Doesn�t Leg Hair Grow Like Head Hair? Nspirement From nspirement.com
Part of the perception that your pubic hair grows much faster than the hair on your head may be due to the growth cycle it follows. The hair on our heads normally stops growing at a certain length, too, most people just cut it short enough that they never notice. And if you never shaved it or trimmed it, it would not grow very long. Being able to grow hair from your head down to your ankles is technically a genetic aberration, albeit a pretty cool one.
