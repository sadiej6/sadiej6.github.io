How to achieve flick up or outturned sides when cutting hair From hairfinder.com
This is the because the neck/shoulders is perpendicular to the hair, pushing them out. I don�t know if this will work for your waves, but one thing i have belatedly discovered that helps the unevenness is to encourage wave formation by plopping and air drying (my hair is too short for this, so i kind of scrunch my hair up with my hands) and using plenty of conditioner and leave ins to keep my waves defined. My hairs naturally curly though, so sometimes i have to run the straighteners through it aswell, but like everyone says, dont hold them on for long or your fringe will stick out. That said, if you are dead set against it, the only way to get rid of it—with your current method of styling—is to cut your hair above your shoulders.
