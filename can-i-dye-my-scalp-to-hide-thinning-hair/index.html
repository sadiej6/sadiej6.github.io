Thin hair magic! Disguise thin and balding hair. YouTube From youtube.com
What i found is interesting, that if you have thinning hair, using highlights can be safer than giving yourself a full dye job. No matter the reason, women can help hide the evidence of grey hair and balding by darkening the scalp and the roots of the hair. I would not recommend this as i think it was really damaging, not only to my hair but my scalp. It is a good idea to avoid a high contrast in color between your hair and your scalp.
